# Hey 👋 I'm Garan

🚀 Aspiring Software & Web Developer with a passion for solving real-world problems through practical tech projects. I'm self-taught through structured programs like [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), and I love diving deep into hands-on builds—from Raspberry Pi home labs to cloud-native development with Azure.

## 🔧 Current Skill Stack
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, basic SQL
- **Infra & Tools:** Linux (Raspbian/Ubuntu), SSH, OpenMediaVault, WireGuard VPN, SMB/CIFS
- **Cloud:** Microsoft Azure (AZ-900 certified)
- **Security:** CompTIA Security+ | ISC² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)

## 📦 Projects & Highlights
- 🧰 **Raspberry Pi 5 NAS with OpenMediaVault**: Configured multi-user file sharing with secure remote access via WireGuard
- 🌐 **Personal Portfolio Website (in progress)**: Showcasing my projects, documentation style, and resume
- 🧪 Ongoing dev projects that mix cloud architecture, web development, and network tinkering

## 🎯 What I'm Working Toward
- Junior developer or IT infrastructure role where I can grow and contribute
- Clean, documented code and strong Git/GitHub workflows
- Collaborating with devs and tech teams that value curiosity and clear communication

## 📫 Let’s Connect!
I'm open to opportunities and relocation—especially in Tampa, FL or Charlotte, NC.
