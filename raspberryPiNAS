# Raspberry Pi 5 NAS + Secure Remote Access

This project transforms a Raspberry Pi 5 into a functional, secure, and remotely accessible Network Attached Storage (NAS) solution using **OpenMediaVault** and **WireGuard VPN**. Designed to showcase hands-on Linux administration, VPN configuration, and multi-user storage setup—all on a compact, energy-efficient platform.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
- Raspberry Pi 5 (SD-based storage due to SSD detection issue)
- OpenMediaVault 6 (Debian-based NAS OS)
- WireGuard VPN (via OMV plugin and PiVPN)
- SMB/CIFS for file sharing across Windows/macOS/Linux
- SSH for remote administration
- Raspbian Lite (base OS)

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Set up reliable, scalable NAS for local and remote access
- Enable multi-user file permissions and role-based access
- Ensure secure remote connectivity from mobile devices via VPN
- Document challenges and solutions for recruiter-ready presentation

## 🚀 Features
- 🔐 Secure access via WireGuard (tested on iOS/Android)
- 🗃️ SMB file sharing with custom user/group permissions
- 📡 Remote configuration through SSH and OMV web UI
- 🧱 Modular structure for future expansion (e.g. Docker containers, cloud sync)
- 🔍 Lightweight monitoring and logs for troubleshooting

## ⚠️ Technical Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge                            | Solution                                     |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| SSD not detected via USB            | Pivoted to SD-based storage + documented issue |
| WireGuard not appearing in OMV UI   | Enabled OMV-Extras + manually configured VPN |
| Multi-device remote access issues   | Refined configuration profiles per device    |

## 📝 Setup Overview
1. Flash Raspbian Lite to SD card
2. Install OMV via official script
3. Configure static IP, user groups, shared folders via OMV
4. Install WireGuard using OMV-Extras or PiVPN
5. Generate peer configurations for mobile clients
6. Test VPN connection and verify external access
